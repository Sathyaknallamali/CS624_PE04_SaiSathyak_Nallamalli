INPUT
 Starting with a dataset called cardsData, the software defines an array of items.  Every item is a user profile with attributes including id, name, occupation, and description.  Displayed in a card style, the application uses this information as input.


 PROCESS

 Index, the primary component, uses React's useState hook to control the state of the presently expanded card.  Users can expand or collapse cards by means of the toggleCard function, which changes the state depending on their interaction.  Using the renderCard function to show every card, the FlatList component effectively renders the list of cards.  Depending on whether the card is expanded or compressed, the Card component renders the individual card's UI, comprising the profile image and content.

 OUTPUT

 Aesthetically pleasing grid of user profile cards is produced by the application.  Every card shows a profile picture and basic information that, when clicked, expands to show more information.  The design is responsive, changing to fit various screen sizes, and offers a seamless user experience via touch interactions.
